9 : Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Here we restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to...
10 : Th-that Trainer Card! That wonderful shade! That sparkle! I’ve seen several Trainers with Silver Trainer Cards already... But you’re the first to top them all with that impressive Trainer Card. Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], may I please heal your Pokémon?
11 : Great to see you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You want the usual, right?
12 : Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
13 : Happy birthday to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! It’s your special day!
14 : I’m wishing from the bottom of my heart that this will be a wonderful year for you!
15 : Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Today is a special day! I know it’s a day early, but happy birthday to you!
